# MarIA 
#### Video Demo:  
#### Description:

        My final project for CS50x it's a programming AI powered by the OpenAI API and
    based on the ChatGPT artificial intelligence called "MarIA". 
    
        Since the rise of new neural networks and artificial intelligences, one that
    stood up recently was chatGPT which really caught my attention because of
    all of the incredible things it could do for you. So I really wanted
    to adapt it in my own way using HTML, CSS, Javascript and Node, as well as JSON.

        MarIA's purpose it's to provide anyone who uses it with the
    vast amount of knowledge in computer science and coding that it
    has. It can help you to solve coding problems, develop new ones,
    educate you in any programming topic that you ask it to and so
    much more.

        All you have to do is verbally write what you want it to do and
    it will display the response. You can talk with it, ask it questions
    and even ask her to explain code for you, the posibilities are endless
    to what it can do.

        I wanna give credit to OpenAI since i'm using their API in my web application. 
    The porpuse of this project is to grant you access to this awesome technology 
    that can potentially help you a lot if you let it. I am Carlos Osorio and it's been a pleasure.
